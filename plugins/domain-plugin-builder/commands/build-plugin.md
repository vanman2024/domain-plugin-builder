**Arguments**: $ARGUMENTS

Goal: Build a complete, validated Claude Code plugin from scratch by chaining all plugin builder commands and validating the final result.

Core Principles:
- Track progress with TodoWrite throughout the build
- Chain commands sequentially for proper dependencies
- Validate at each major phase
- Ensure 100% compliance before completion

Phase 1: Load Framework Documentation & Discovery
Goal: Understand plugin building framework and what needs to be built

Actions:
- Load plugin building framework docs:
  @~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/domain-plugin-builder/plugins/domain-plugin-builder/docs/frameworks/claude/component-decision-framework.md
  @~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/domain-plugin-builder/plugins/domain-plugin-builder/docs/frameworks/plugins/claude-code-plugin-structure.md

  These provide critical context for:
  - When to use commands vs agents vs skills
  - Plugin directory structure and manifest format
  - Component design patterns
  - Validation requirements

- Create todo list with all build phases using TodoWrite
- Parse $ARGUMENTS for plugin name
- If unclear or no plugin name provided, use AskUserQuestion to gather:
  - What's the plugin name?
  - Plugin type? (SDK, Framework, Custom)
  - For SDK: Which SDK? (Claude Agent SDK, FastMCP, etc.)
  - For Framework: Which framework? (React, Next.js, etc.)
  - Languages supported? (TypeScript, Python, JavaScript)

Phase 2: Create Plugin Scaffold
Goal: Build initial plugin structure

Actions:

Use SlashCommand tool to invoke plugin-create:

!{bash /domain-plugin-builder:plugin-create $ARGUMENTS}

This will:
- Create plugin directory structure
- Generate plugin.json manifest
- Create root files (README, LICENSE, etc.)
- Build initial commands and agents
- Run initial validation

Wait for plugin-create to complete before proceeding.

Update TodoWrite to mark plugin scaffold complete.

Phase 3: Verify Plugin Structure
Goal: Ensure plugin was created correctly

Actions:

Check that plugin exists and has basic structure:
- Verify directory: plugins/$ARGUMENTS exists
- Verify plugin.json exists
- List created commands and agents

If any issues found, stop and report errors.

Update TodoWrite to mark verification complete.

Phase 4: Final Validation
Goal: Comprehensive validation of entire plugin

Actions:

Use Task tool to invoke the plugin-validator agent:

Task(description="Validate complete plugin", subagent_type="domain-plugin-builder:plugin-validator", prompt="You are the plugin-validator agent. Validate the complete plugin at plugins/$ARGUMENTS.

Run all validation scripts:
- validate-all.sh for comprehensive checks
- Check command compliance
- Check agent compliance
- Verify documentation quality
- Check template adherence
- Validate framework conventions

Output comprehensive report with Overall Status: PASS/FAIL/PASS WITH WARNINGS

Plugin to validate: plugins/$ARGUMENTS
Expected deliverable: Detailed validation report with status and any issues found")

Wait for agent to complete and return its report.

Read the agent's validation report output.

Parse the report for validation status:
- Look for "Overall Status: PASS" → Validation successful, continue to Phase 5
- Look for "Overall Status: FAIL" → Validation failed, need to fix issues
- Look for "Overall Status: PASS WITH WARNINGS" → Acceptable, continue with warnings

If validation status is FAIL:
- Read the "Critical Issues" and "Warnings" sections from report
- Identify auto-fixable issues:
  - Line length problems → Trim descriptions
  - ARGUMENTS usage errors → Replace numbered args with $ARGUMENTS
  - Missing @ symbols → Add @ prefix to file loading
  - Missing frontmatter fields → Add required fields
- Show issues to user
- Use AskUserQuestion: "Auto-fix common issues or manual fix?"
- If auto-fix selected:
  - Apply fixes using Edit tool based on issues in report
  - Re-invoke plugin-validator agent using Task tool on plugins/$ARGUMENTS
  - Wait for new report
  - Parse new report status
  - Loop until Overall Status is PASS or PASS WITH WARNINGS
- If manual fix selected:
  - Show detailed errors from report
  - Pause for user to fix manually
  - After user confirms fixes, re-invoke validator using Task tool

Continue looping until Overall Status: PASS or PASS WITH WARNINGS achieved.

Update TodoWrite to mark validation complete.

Phase 5: Git Commit and Push
Goal: Save all work immediately to GitHub

Actions:

**CRITICAL: Commit and push ALL plugin files and marketplace updates**

Stage all files related to the plugin:
!{bash git add plugins/$ARGUMENTS .claude-plugin/marketplace.json .claude/settings.local.json}

Commit with descriptive message:
!{bash git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat: Build complete $ARGUMENTS plugin

Complete plugin with commands, agents, skills, validation, and documentation.

)"}

**IMMEDIATELY push to GitHub:**

!{bash git push origin master}

This ensures work is never lost. If push fails:
- Check git remote configuration
- Verify GitHub credentials
- Push manually: `git push origin master`

Update TodoWrite to mark git commit/push complete.

Phase 6: Summary
Goal: Document what was built

Actions:
- Mark all todos as complete using TodoWrite
- Display comprehensive summary:
  - Plugin name and type
  - Location: plugins/$ARGUMENTS
  - Components created:
    * X commands
    * Y agents
    * Z skills (if any)
  - Validation status: ✅ ALL PASSED
  - Plugin manifest: .claude-plugin/plugin.json
  - Documentation: README.md
  - **Git Status:**
    * ✅ Committed to master branch
    * ✅ Pushed to GitHub origin/master
- Show next steps:
  - Test plugin commands
  - Deploy to marketplace
  - Create additional features
- Report format: Plugin name, type, location, component counts, validation status, next steps
